    In monotheistic thought, God is usually viewed as the supreme being, creator, and principal 
    object of faith.[1] God is typically conceived as being omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, 
    and omnibenevolent, as well as having an eternal and necessary existence. God is often thought 
    to be incorporeal, evoking transcendence or immanence.[1][2][3]
Some religions describe God without reference to gender, while others use terminology that is 
gender-specific and gender-biased. God has been conceived as either personal or impersonal. In 
theism, God is the creator and sustainer of the universe, while in deism, God is the creator, but 
not the sustainer, of the universe. In pantheism, God is the universe itself, while in panentheism, 
the universe is part (but not the whole) of God. Atheism is an absence of belief in God or any other 
deity, while agnosticism is the belief that the existence of God is unknown or unknowable. God has 
also been conceived as the source of all moral obligation, and the "greatest conceivable existent".[1]
Many notable theologians and philosophers have developed arguments for and against the existence of God.[4]
 God is referred to by different names depending on the language and cultural tradition with titles sometimes
  used referring to God's attributes.
  The earliest written form of the Germanic word God comes from the 6th-century Christian Codex Argenteus. 
  The English word itself is derived from the Proto-Germanic *ǥuđan. The reconstructed Proto-Indo-European 
  form *ǵhu-tó-m was likely based on the root *ǵhau(ə)-, which meant either "to call" or "to invoke".[5] 
  The Germanic words for God were originally neuter—applying to both genders—but during the process of the 
  Christianization of the Germanic peoples from their indigenous Germanic paganism, the words became a 
  masculine syntactic form.[6] In the English language, capitalization is used when 
  the word is used as a proper noun, as well as for other names by which a god is known.[7] Consequently, 
  the capitalized form of god is not used for multiple gods or when used to refer to the generic idea of a 
  deity.[8][9] The English word God and its counterparts in other languages are normally used for any and 
  all conceptions and, in spite of significant differences between religions, the term remains an English 
  translation common to all.
El means God in Hebrew, but in Judaism and in Christianity, God is also given a personal name, the 
tetragrammaton YHWH, in origin possibly the name of an Edomite or Midianite deity, Yahweh.[10] In many English 
translations of the Bible, when the word LORD is in all capitals, it signifies that the word represents the 
tetragrammaton.[11] Jah or Yah is an abbreviation of Jahweh/Yahweh, and often sees usage by Jews and Christians
 in the interjection "Hallelujah", meaning "Praise Jah", which is used to give God glory.[12] In Judaism some 
 of the Hebrew titles of God are considered holy names.
Allāh (Arabic: الله) is the Arabic term with no plural used by Muslims and Arabic speaking Christians and Jews 
meaning "The God", while ʾilāh (Arabic: إِلَٰه plural `āliha آلِهَة) is the term used for a deity or a god in 
general.[13][14][15] Muslims also use a multitude of other titles for God.In Hinduism, Brahman is often
 considered a monistic concept of God.[16] God may also be given a proper name in monotheistic currents of 
 Hinduism which emphasize the personal nature of God, with early references to his name as Krishna-Vasudeva in 
 Bhagavata or later Vishnu and Hari.[17] Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa is the term used in Balinese Hinduism.[18
In Chinese religion, Shangdi is conceived as the progenitor (first ancestor) of the universe, intrinsic to it 
and constantly bringing order to Ahura Mazda is the name for God used in Zoroastrianism. "Mazda", or rather the
 Avestan stem-form Mazdā-, nominative Mazdå, reflects Proto-Iranian *Mazdāh (female). It is generally taken to 
 be the proper name of the spirit, and like its Sanskrit cognate medhā, means "intelligence" or "wisdom". Both 
 the Avestan and Sanskrit words reflect Proto-Indo-Iranian *mazdhā-, from Proto-Indo-European mn̩sdʰeh1, 
 literally meaning "placing (dʰeh1) one's mind (*mn̩-s)", hence "wise".[19] Meanwhile 101 other names are also 
 in use.[20]Waheguru (Punjabi: vāhigurū) is a term most often used in Sikhism to refer to God.[21] It means
  "Wonderful Teacher" in the Punjabi language. Vāhi (a Middle Persian borrowing) means "wonderful" and guru
   (Sanskrit: guru) is a term denoting "teacher". Waheguru is also described by some as an experience of
    ecstasy which is beyond all descriptions. The most common usage of the word "Waheguru" is in the greeting 
    Sikhs use with each other - Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa, Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh "Wonderful Lord's Khalsa, Victory 
    is to the Wonderful Lord."Baha, the "greatest" name for God in the Baháʼí Faith, is Arabic for "All-Glorious".Other names for God include
 Aten[23] in ancient Egyptian Atenism where Aten was proclaimed to be the one "true" supreme being and creator
  of the universe,[24] Chukwu in Igbo,[25] and Hayyi Rabbi in Mandaeism.[26][27]
